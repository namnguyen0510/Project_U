**U and A story**: 
Hi, my name is Anthony and I'm raising money for my love one who is in critical condition from the Guillain-Barre Syndrome . On January 12, 2023, Uyen had difficulty opening her eye and speaking. I took her to the ER and waited for a specialist to find out she has been diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome. GBS is a weakness occurring when the immune system attacks and damages the nervous system.

Currently, she is unable to move except for her feet and is stuck on a ventilator. She can't communicate other than moving her two feet for yes and no. Doctors say that the damages will be lifelong and recovery for most patients begin at 6 months. We are anticipating needing to pay for any uncovered medical bills, home rehabilitation, and uninsured rehabilitation treatment.

Thank you so much for your love and support.
Anthony Bui
